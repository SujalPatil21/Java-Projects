# Armstrong Number Checker

A simple Java program to **check if a given number is an Armstrong number**.  
An Armstrong number (also called a narcissistic number) is a number in which the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.  
For example:  
- 153 → 1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153  
- 370 → 3³ + 7³ + 0³ = 370
