# Java Projects

A collection of Java projects and exercises designed to demonstrate programming fundamentals, problem-solving skills, and object-oriented programming concepts. This repository will showcase projects ranging from small practice programs to more advanced applications as I progress in Java development.

## Purpose

- Practice and strengthen Java programming skills.
- Explore object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.
- Build a portfolio of projects for learning and professional showcase.

## Planned Projects

- Calculator
- Number Guessing Game
- Tic-Tac-Toe
- Banking Management System
- Library Management System
- Student Grade Calculator

> More projects will be added over time, categorized by complexity and skill level.

## Technologies

- Java 23
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Core Java concepts: loops, conditionals, classes, objects, arrays, file handling

## How to Use

Each project will have its own folder with a `README.md` and instructions on how to compile and run the program.  

This repository is a work in progress and will be updated regularly as new projects are added.
